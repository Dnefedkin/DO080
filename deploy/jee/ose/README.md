# Steps to deploy the To Do List application in OSE

* Have "Environment 2 (from DO280)" setup as explained by setup/README.md
* Follow demo 5.1 instructions:
  * Most steps are done from the master vm using the CLI.
  * But steps 5,6 and 12 need a web browser so this should be started from either the workstation vm or the f0 machine (it works from ssh -X)
